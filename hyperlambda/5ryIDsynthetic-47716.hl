// How to use [data.select] - With Python equivalent

/*
 * To execute SQL towards some database, we first must open a database connection.
 * 
 * This invocation uses the default database type being SQLite, and connects to warehouse database file, that can be found under /data/warehouse.db
 */
data.connect:warehouse

   // This executes the specified SQL
   data.select:select first_name, last_name from admins limit 5

/*
 * How it will look like after execution:
 * data.connect
 * data.select
 * ""
 * first_name:PENELOPE
 * last_name:GUINESS
 * ""
 * first_name:NICK
 * last_name:WAHLBERG
 * ""
 * first_name:ED
 * last_name:CHASE
 * ""
 * first_name:JENNIFER
 * last_name:DAVIS
 * ""
 * first_name:JOHNNY
 * last_name:LOLLOBRIGIDA
 */

# Python equivalent
import sqlite3

def select_admin_names(database_name):
    # Connect to the warehouse database
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database_name)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    try:
        # Prepare and execute the select statement
        query = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM admins LIMIT 5"
        cursor.execute(query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        return results
    finally:
        conn.close()

# Example usage
database_name = 'warehouse.db'
admin_names = select_admin_names(database_name)
for name in admin_names:
    print(name)
