// Example: Allowed set includes all characters in the input (no replacements occur). - With Python equivalent
.input:ABC123
strings.replace-not-of:x:@.input
   .:ABC123
   .:#

// Result: "ABC123" (unchanged, since all characters were allowed)


/*

# Python equivalent
# Subject string
subject = "Test"

# Extract the entire string using its full length
substring = subject[0:4]
