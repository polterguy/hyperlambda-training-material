/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates using `not-null` in an `if` condition.
 *
 * 1. The `.data` node has a child `foo` with a value `"bar"`.
 * 2. The `if` statement checks if `foo` is not null.
 * 3. If `foo` is not null, an exception will be thrown
 *
 * Result: An exception is thrown since `foo` has a value
