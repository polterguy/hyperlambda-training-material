// Multiply a number by the result of a nested addition

// outer multiplication
math.multiply

   // first factor (base) is 5
   .:int:5

   // nested addition (executes before multiplication)
   math.add

      // first addend

      // second addend (1 + 2 = 3)
      .:int:2
   // After the inner addition yields 3, we have 5 * 3 = 15 as the final result
