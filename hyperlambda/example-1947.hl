// This snippet uses the '[x|y]' iterator to filter by multiple node names.
.set
   apple:red
   banana:yellow
   cherry:red
   date:brown
for-each:x:@.set/*/[apple|cherry]
   set-value:x:@.dp/#
      :picked

// The expression @.set/*/[apple|cherry] selects all children of .set whose name is "apple" or "cherry". The loop sets those nodes' values to "picked".
