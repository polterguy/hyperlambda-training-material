// This snippet uses the '[n,n]' iterator to select a range of child nodes.
.items
   item0:A
   item1:B
   item2:C
for-each:x:@.items/*/[0,2]  
   set-value:x:@.dp/#
      :selected
// The expression @.items/*/[0,2] selects children from index 0 up to 2 (exclusive) â€“ i.e., the first and second children (item0 and item1). The loop marks them as "selected".
