/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates retrieving the first available value from multiple nodes.
 *
 * 1. The `.data` node has three children with values (`bar1`, `bar2`, `bar3`).
 * 2. The `get-first-value` slot is given three possible `get-value` calls.
 * 3. The second `get-value` retrieves `bar2`, which is returned.
