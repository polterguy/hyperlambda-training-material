/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates using a static fallback value.
 *
 * 1. The `.data` node contains `foo1` and `foo2`, both with `"error"` values.
 * 2. The `get-first-value` slot attempts to retrieve values from `.data`, but they are not desirable.
 * 3. A static `"success"` value is provided as a fallback, and it is returned.
