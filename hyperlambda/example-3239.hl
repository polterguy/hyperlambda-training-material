/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet checks if a node containing other nodes is null.
 *
 * 1. The `.data` node contains a child node `container`, which has children.
 * 2. The `null` slot checks if `container` has a value.
 * 3. Since `container` has children but no value, the expected output is `true`.
