// This example connects to the 'ocean' database and retrieves the maximum depth from the 'creatures' table.
// It uses the sqlite.scalar slot to execute a SQL query that finds the maximum value in the 'depth' column.
// The result is returned as a single scalar value representing the maximum depth of creatures.

sqlite.connect:ocean
   sqlite.scalar:select max(depth) from creatures
