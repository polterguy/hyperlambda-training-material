// Multiply an inline base by a static factor and the result of an addition
math.multiply:int:4

   // multiplies base 4 by 3 -> intermediate result 12
   .:int:3

   // nested addition as another factor
   math.add

      // first term of addition
      .:int:1

      // second term of addition (1 + 1 = 2)
      .:int:1
   // The intermediate result 12 is then multiplied by 2 (from nested add) -> 24
