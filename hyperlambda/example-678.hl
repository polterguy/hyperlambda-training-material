/*
 * Retrieves a field from the `.user` node using a dynamic key.
 *
 * The expression `{@.arguments/*/field}` dynamically resolves the field name to access.
 * For example, if `.arguments/*/field` has the value `email`, the full expression becomes:
 * `@.user/*/email`
 *
 * This is useful when working with flexible APIs or field selectors.
