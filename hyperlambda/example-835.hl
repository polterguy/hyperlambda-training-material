// What are lambda expressions?

/*
 * Lambda expressions in Hyperlambda are used to reference any node within the currently executing graph object.
 * They allow for dynamic access to nodes, enabling you to express relationships and hierarchies in the nodes effectively.
 * They are similar to XPath expressions found in other technologies.
 */

// Example of a simple lambda expression referencing the [.person] node.
.person:John
set-value:x:@.person
   .:Jane

// In this case, @.person is a lambda expression that points to the .person node, and the [set-value] slot changes its value.
