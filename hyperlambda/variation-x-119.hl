/*
 * This Hyperlambda snippet demonstrates stopping iteration early using `return`.
 * 
 * 1. The `.foo1` node has three children (`bar1`, `bar2`, `bar3`).
 * 2. The `for-each` slot iterates over each child.
 * 3. The `return` slot immediately exits the loop after the first iteration.
 * 4. The expected execution count of our [for-each] loop is 1.
