/*
 * Hyperlambda endpoint taking arguments. This SQL query selects media types and their aggregate counts, ordering the results by count in descending order, filtered by a specified name pattern.
 * 
 * The SQL code is executed within a SQLite database connection to the Chinook database. It performs an inner join between the MediaType and Track tables to count the occurrences of each media type. The query filters media types based on a provided pattern using the LIKE operator, groups the results by MediaTypeId, and orders them by the count of tracks associated with each media type in descending order. This allows users to retrieve media type information and their usage frequency, filtered by a specific name pattern, from the Chinook database.
 * 
 * All arguments are mandatory.
