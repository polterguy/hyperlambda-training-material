// This snippet uses the '*' iterator to retrieve all children of a node, in addition to the # reference iterator.
.data
   item1: one
   item2: two
for-each:x:@.data/*   
   set-value:x:@.dp/#
      :processed
// The expression @.data/* selects both item1 and item2 nodes, and the for-each loop sets each of their values to "processed" since it's using the [.dp] node by reference which is injected by the [for-each] slot.
