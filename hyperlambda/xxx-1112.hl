// How to use Hyperlambda's [try-signal]
Invokes a previously created dynamic slot. This slots works exactly the same as **[signal]** except it does
not throw an exception if the slot does not exist. Assuming you have created the foo slot from the create slot example,
you can invoke the slot using the following Hyperlambda.
```
try-signal:foo
```
