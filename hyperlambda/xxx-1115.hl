// How to use Hyperlambda's [return-nodes]
Returns a bunch of nodes (lambda) from your slot. Can only be invoked from the inside of
a dynamically created slot, and other slots explicitly creating a return context. An example can be
found below.
```
slots.create:foo
   return-nodes
      integer-value:int:57
      string-value:Foo bar
signal:foo
```
