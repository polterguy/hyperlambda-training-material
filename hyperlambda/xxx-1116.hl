// How to use Hyperlambda's [return-value]
Returns a single value from your slot. Can only be invoked from the inside of
a dynamically created slot, and other slots explicitly creating a return context. An example can be
found below.
```
slots.create:foo
   return-value:This becomes the returned value from your slot
signal:foo
```
