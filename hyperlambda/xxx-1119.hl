// Usage
"All the above slots that requires two arguments, will use the first argument as its _\"what\"_ argument, and the second"
"as its _\"with\"_ argument. Avoiding naming these though, allows you to reference other slots, and use these as sources"
to parametrize your invocations to the above slots. Below is an example of how this would look like.
```
.data:Hyperlambda is cool
strings.replace:x:-
