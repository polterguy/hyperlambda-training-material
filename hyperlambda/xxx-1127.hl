// How to use Hyperlambda's [strings.join]
Similar to **[strings.concat]**, except it also takes an optional separating character, allowing you to
concatenate a bunch of strings, and making sure each original string is separated by some sequence of strings.
```
.src
   .:foo
   .:bar
strings.join:x:@.src/*
   .:,

// Results in "foo,bar"
```
#
