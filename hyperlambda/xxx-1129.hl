// How to use Hyperlambda's [strings.regex-replace]
Replaces matches of the given regular expression with some static sequence of characters.
```

// Results in "FOO bar hansen"
strings.regex-replace:foo bar hansen
   .:fo+
   .:FOO
```
The first argument is what regular expression to match, the second argument is what to replace
all matches with.
