// How to use Hyperlambda's [strings.substring]
Returns a substring of the specified string.
```
.input:Foo Bar Howdy World
strings.substring:x:-
   .:5
   .:7
```
The above will result in the following.
```
strings.substring:ar Howd
```
Notice, the second argument is the _number of characters to return_ and not the offset into the string
of where to stop returning. In such a regard, it works the same way as the C# `Substring` method.
