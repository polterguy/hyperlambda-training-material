// How to use Hyperlambda's [tasks.execute]
You can explicitly execute a persisted task by invoking **[tasks.execute]** and pass
"in the ID of your task. Below is an example, that assumes you have created the above _\"foo-bar-task-4\"_ task"
first.
```
tasks.execute:foo-bar-task-4
```
Notice, if you try to execute a non-existing task, an exception will be thrown.
