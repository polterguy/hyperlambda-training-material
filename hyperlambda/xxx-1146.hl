// How to use Hyperlambda's [tasks.get]
To inspect a task you can use the following.
```
tasks.get:task-id
```
The above will return the Hyperlambda for your task, in addition to your task's description. If you add
a **[schedules]** argument and set its value to boolean `true`, this slot will also return all schedules
associated with the task.
```
tasks.get:task-id
   schedules:true
```
