// How Hyperlambda tasks are stored
All tasks are persisted into your `magic` database, either in MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.
This implies that even if your server is stopped, all scheduled tasks and persisted tasks will automatically
load up again, and be available and re-scheduled as the server is restarted. This _might_ imply that
all tasks in the past are immediately executed, which is important for you to understand, since any tasks
with a due date in the past, are executed immediately as the server restarts again.
Tasks are by default persisted into your `tasks` table, and schedules are persisted into your
`task_due` table.
