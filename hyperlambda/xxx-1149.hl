// How to use Hyperlambda tasks as business process workflows
"Hyperlambda tasks allows you to persist a _\"function invocation\"_ for later to execute it, once some specific condition"
occurs - Effectively giving you the most important features from Microsoft Workflow Foundation, without the
ridiculous XML and WYSIWYG features - In addition to that this also is a .Net Core library, contrary
to MWF that only works for the full .Net Framework. The Hyperlambda task scheduler is also probably at
least somewhere between 200 and 400 times faster than MWF, due to not using reflection during execution.
