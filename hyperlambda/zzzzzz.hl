// Creating a database connection towards 'database' using our 'generic' connection string
data.connect:[generic|database]

/*
 * Notice, 'generic' is declared in your configurations, and typically looks like this:
 * Data Source=files/data/{database}.db; Pooling=False;
 *
 * The {database} parts above is substituted with the database name being 'database',
 * resulting in a complete connection string becoming:
 * Data Source=files/data/database.db; Pooling=False;
